My notes on the diffs I am hitting going from 2 to 3
(good site for more is at http://www.diveintopython3.net/porting-code-to-python-3-with-2to3.html )

Things I've run into:
1) print                                [seen this for years]
2) zip is an iterator
3) iteritems is gone from dict
4) iterator.next() is now __next__()    [pep 3114  https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3114/]
5) range is an iterable
6) unicode() builtin is gone
7) file() builtin is gone
8) unichr() builtin is gone
9) xrange() is gone
10) basestring() is gone -- use str
11) Removed reduce(). Use functools.reduce()
12) Removed reload(). Use imp.reload().
13) Removed long() (now merged with int())
14) Removed raw_input() -- actually renamed to input -- use  eval(input()) if want raw input
15) Added ascii()
