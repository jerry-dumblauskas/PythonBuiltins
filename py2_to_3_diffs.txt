My notes on the diffs I am hitting going from 2 to 3
(good site for more is at http://www.diveintopython3.net/porting-code-to-python-3-with-2to3.html )

Things I've run into:
1) print                                [seen this for years]
2) zip is an iterator
3) iteritems is gone from dict
4) iterator.next() is now __next__()    [pep 3114  https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3114/]
5) range is an iterable
6)
