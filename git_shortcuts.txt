git shortcuts

the `git remote add` command takes two arguments:

A remote name, for example, origin
A remote URL, for example, https://github.com/user/repo.git

===TO ADD AN UPSTREAM===
git remote add upstream https://github.com/DataBrewery/cubes.git
git fetch upstream

===TO DIFF BETWEEN TWO REMOTES===
git diff origin/master upstream/master

===TO MERGE A FORK TO THE NEW HEAD===
git fetch upstream
git checkout master # should already be on master
git merge upstream/master
